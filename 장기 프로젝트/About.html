                                    Worked as an English Teacher. <br>
                                    I taught many students from 5th grades to 9th grades about the basic English
                                    grammars and vocabularies. <br>
                                    I worked there in the middle of July, 2019 for 7months. <br>
                                    Working there improved my English skills a lot. <br>

                                <h4><i>January, 2022 ~ August, 2022</i></h4>
                                <p>
                                    Worked as a Programming Teacher. <br>
                                    I taught a group of four middle school students about the algorithms using C
                                    language. They were to get a prize in Korea Olympiad in Informatics(KOI),<br>
                                    and one of them got a silver prize, one of them failed and the rest got a
                                    participation prize. <br>
                                    It was also a challenge for me to teach them as it is hard to teach computer
                                    algorithms to other people and even they are not majoring the computer science. <br>
                                    Also I have a special student, who was a new one to the programming and wants to
                                    major in this field. He apparently does know nothing about the programming
                                    languages, so I had to start off from Python and the basic knowledge about a
                                    computer. <br>
                                    I have taught him from the beginning, and that was a chance for me to go back to
                                    basics, then some algorithms. Finally right before a month I decided to resign, we
                                    start off a project designing a blog by building a server, database and the
                                    front-end page using Django. <br>
                                    I had never used Django framework so I learned a lot through the project as well as
                                    he did. From these experiences, I got a communication skills and also was able to
                                    get a deeper understanding of programming than before.
